# Digital-and-Microcontroller-Devices_22Fall
Digital and Microcontroller Devices projects during 22Fall semester at ITMO university 

Below is a simple table of contents for the Practice : 

- Practice 1 ： 
  - Control systems with discrete PID controller.
- Practice 2 ： 
  - Dead-beat controllers
- Practice 3 ： 
  - Calculate parameters of digital PID controller via pole-assignment design.
  - Calculate parameters of digital PID controller via measured step function method
- Practice 4 ： 
  - use two methods to accomplish the LED light flashing and key LED flow lights representing binary numbers:
    - Use the HAL library 
    - Work with registers
- Practice 5 ： 
  - uses STM32CubeIDE, MATLAB for signal generation, sending and, transmission.
- Practice 6 ： 
  - STM32CubeIDE, Matlab, H-bridge circuits and PID controllers are used to realize the precise control of the angular position of the servo motor.
